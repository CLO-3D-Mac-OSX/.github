## What is CLO 3D?  

**CLO 3D** is a cutting-edge **3D fashion design and simulation platform** that revolutionizes the way garments are designed, visualized, and produced. Tailored for fashion designers, pattern makers, and apparel developers, it provides an immersive digital environment for creating realistic clothing prototypes without the need for physical samples.  

Using advanced garment simulation technology, CLO 3D allows designers to drape, fit, and modify clothing on 3D avatars with lifelike accuracy. Every fabric fold, texture, and motion responds naturally to body movement, making it an essential tool for visualizing how real materials behave in motion.  

The software supports **import and export of 2D patterns**, letting users transition seamlessly between digital pattern design and 3D visualization. It also integrates with industry-standard tools such as **Adobe Illustrator** and **Browzwear**, enabling efficient workflows between concept and production.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon**, CLO 3D delivers faster rendering speeds, smoother navigation, and enhanced real-time simulation. Whether you’re creating runway collections, virtual fittings, or digital twins for e-commerce, CLO 3D brings innovation and sustainability to the fashion design process.
